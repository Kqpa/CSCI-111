For array size of 1000: 
    499,500 comparisons
    ~723,441 moves on avarage
For array size of 2000:
    1,999,000 comparisons
    ~3,040,324 moves on avarage
For array size of 4000:
    7,998,000 comparisons
    ~11,504,102 moves on avarage

When n doubles, the comparisons quadruple which indicates a quadratic relationship,
which can be denoted as O(n^2). Moves also grow quadratically, resulting into an 
overall time complexity of O(n^2).

When n doubles, the comparisons quadruple which indicates a quadratic relationship,
which can be denoted as O(n^2). Although, for almost sorted arrays the moves grow close
to a liner relationship, which ultimately is negligable for the resultant time complexity,
thus having an overall O(n^2) time complexity.
